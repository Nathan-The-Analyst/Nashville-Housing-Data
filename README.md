# Nashville-Housing-Data


Through this project, I utilized SQL to analyze Nashville housing data and extract valuable insights crucial for decision-making in the real estate sector.

The Process Involved:

Data Cleaning: I meticulously processed and cleaned the Nashville housing dataset using SQL queries to ensure data integrity and consistency. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing any inconsistencies in the dataset.

Data Exploration: Leveraging SQL's querying capabilities, I conducted comprehensive exploration of the Nashville housing data to identify significant trends and patterns. By writing SQL queries to filter, aggregate, and analyze the data, I gained insights into various aspects of the local real estate market, such as property types, neighborhoods, prices, and square footage.

Data Visualization: Although SQL itself doesn't offer visualization tools, I exported the analyzed data to visualization platforms or utilized external tools to create compelling charts and graphs. These visualizations effectively communicated the insights derived from the Nashville housing data analysis, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions.

Overall, by harnessing the power of SQL, I transformed raw Nashville housing data into actionable insights, providing valuable information for real estate professionals and investors.
